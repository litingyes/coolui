# Introduction

**Cool UI** is a CSS atomic UI library based on [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/). All its styles are generated by UnoCSS, which is lightweight and easy to reuse.

## Why develop this library ?

- For front-end developers who like to participate in open source and develop their own WEB, an easy-to-use, convenient UI library that can cover most development scenarios can greatly improve development efficiency
- There are many front-end frameworks at present, such as [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [React](https://react.dev/), but there is no simple, beautiful and universal style.
